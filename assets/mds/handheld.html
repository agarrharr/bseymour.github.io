Handheld PC (HPC) vendors will readily admit that their devices are not meant as 
full-time notebook replacements. The target user is someone who needs quick access 
to personal information managment (PIM) data, reasonable access to e-mail, and the 
ability to view and edit small files.
<br>
<br>
In this rapidly expanding market there are currently some key players. Their products vary
in abilities and operating systems. Here are few of the current market leaders:

<b>Casio Cassiopeia E-100</b>
<bR>
The Cassiopeia offers a dazzling 16-bit color display, a whopping 16MB of RAM, and 
a stereo headphone jack. But is prone to occasional system hangs and stutters.

<b>Compaq iPaq H3650</b>
<br>
This shiny, silver speed demon has a great screen and some thoughtful extras that
make it much easier to use than other Pocket PCs. Its processor runs at a brisk 206 
MHz, about 70 MHz faster than the HP Jornada 545 or the Casio Cassiopeia E-115. 
The difference is remarkable, especially when you have several applications running.

<b>Palm IIIx</b>
<br>
the Palm IIIx is practically identical to the older, heftier Palm III. But don't let the familiar 
looks fool you--the Palm IIIx includes more RAM (for a total of 4MB) and features an 
internal expansion slot.

<b>Sony CLIE</b>
<br>
The Palm has undergone yet another face-lift, this time from the masters of high-tech 
design at Sony. The CLIE, Sony's tiny, new handheld, adds two features not seen on 
previous Palm organizers: Memory Stick expansion and a jog dial to aid in navigation. 
These changes aren't a revolution, but they are enough to earn our top recommendation.

<b>HP Jornada 545</b>
<br>
Loaded with the new Pocket PC operating system, the slick HP Jornada 545 Color is 
capable of doing just about anything a business desktop computer can do. From 
Outlook, Word, and Excel to image editing and Web surfing, this handheld does it all.

<b>HP Jornada 820</b>
<br>
This 2.5-pound system packs the best handheld features--easy portability, long battery life, 
instant boot-up, and relative affordability--into a design you could easily mistake for a 
small Windows notebook, even though it's actually bigger than some notebooks.

<b>Psion Revo</b>
<bR>
The Revo, an update of Psion's popular Series 5 device, has a design somewhat reminiscent 
of the first generation of Windows CE handhelds. It combines notebooklike functionality with 
pocket-sized portability, but as with those earlier CE devices, the Revo's miniature keyboard 
can make data input a chore. However, the intuitive interface and smaller size make it a truly 
useful handheld.
