With the explosive growth of mobile phone ownership – more than 40% of the UK 
population now owns a mobile phone – the link between two of today’s hottest technologies 
is expected to create a potent cocktail.
<br>
<br>
In only a couple of years, new telecoms networks that support high-speed mobile 
internet access will be in place and internet-enabled phones are expected to be the 
norm. By 2004, Forrester Research predicts that one-third of Europeans will regularly 
access the internet via their mobile phones.
