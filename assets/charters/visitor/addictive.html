   <br>I stand
   <br>watching the delicate fingers,
   <br>as they creep over scores of music,
   <br>which enchants my senses,
   <br>I watch the soft fingers turn into black, hard coldness.

   <br>It starts to pull at my hair and clothes,
   <br>creeps into my feeling of weakness and tugs,
   <br>pulling me towards the curtains,
   <br>their musty, decaying surface,
   <br>like a chill on my spine.

   <br>I hesitate,
   <br>but the addictive music pushes me on
   <br>and I slowly lose control.
   <br>I scream.
   <br>But the curtain gags my yells
   <br>and I am forced behind the curtains of the unknown.
