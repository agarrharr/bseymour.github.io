   <br>Ship was seasick
   <br>ground and rolled
   <br>more than any cabined soul.
   <br>
   <br>It dreamed
   <br>of trees.
   <br>
   <br>Not oak, nor ash, nor old man yew,
   <br>nor glades of glory drenched dreams,
   <br>nor that surreal hour
   <br>when the trees have turned
   <br>their backs on the sun,
   <br>except for flirting young birches
   <br>who blush gold
   <br>in shining attention.
   <br>
   <br>Just trees,
   <br>company.
   <br>
   <br>As loud as it could 
   <br>to drown out the sea.
   <br>
