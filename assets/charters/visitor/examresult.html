In 1999 Charters School achieved its best ever results at A Level, GCSE
and GNVQ. The Headteacher, Marcia Twelftree, is delighted and stated "These 
excellent results reflect much hard work on the part of the school community. Students, 
staff and parents have worked together to provide the very best learning environment 
for our young people. These results are the best ever in the history of the school, it's 
just absolutely fantastic."
