 <FONT SIZE=+1>YEAR 8 CANTABRIA VISIT 2000</font>
A holiday visit to Northern Spain is proposed for Year 8 pupils studying Spanish during 
May half-term (28th May – 3rd June 2000).  We hope to visit the Cabárceno Nature Reserve, 
the medieval town of Santillana del Mar, a cake factory, go shopping and taste unusual food!  
The three-star, family-run hotel is opposite the blue flag beach.  There will be time for 
supervised beach activities.  The holiday will cost £240, to include return travel by coach, 
full board accommodation, all excursions and insurance.  Letters have been given to all Year 
8 pupils studying Spanish.  Permission slips and a deposit of £50 must be handed in to Mrs
Mathews by Friday 24th September 1999.  Due to the location of the hotel and the nature of
the excursions, places are limited to 40 pupils.  Places will be allocated on a first-come,
first-served basis in consultation with the Head of Year.  Hasta Luego!

<FONT SIZE=+1>HISTORY  DEPARTMENT</font>
<br>Mrs K Hannaby - Head of History
<p>
This week (week beginning 20th September) all Year 7 pupils will be taking part in the 
History House Competition.  Pupils will be asked to explain, in no more than 300 words,
why Florence Nightingale, Neil Armstrong, Emily Pankhurst and Winston Churchill deserve 
to have a house named after them.  History lessons during this week will take place in 
the Library to allow pupils to undertake research.  Five prizes will be awarded.  There 
will be one prize for the most original entry in each House and also an overall prize winner.
House points will also be awarded.

<FONT SIZE=+1>SCIENCE DEPARTMENT</font>
<br>Mrs H Davies - Head of Biology
<p>
Each Year, the Science department takes part in the Nuffield Science Bursary Scheme. 
Students are able to spend four weeks working with post graduates and academic professionals
in areas of research. This year Gabrielle Ng took part.
<br>
"I spent 4 weeks during the Summer at the Centre for Population Biology, Imperial 
College at Silwood Park in Sunningdale.  I was working alongside graduate and undergraduate
students on several ecology-based research projects.  From the very first day, all the
staff and students were friendly, co-operative and made me feel welcome.  This has been
an incredible learning experience and has given me a valuable insight into a part of 
science that I did not know much about.  I would recommend it to all lower sixth Biology 
students who are considering pursuing a career in Biology or any science based research"

<FONT SIZE=+1> ART DEPARTMENT</font>
<br>Mrs Lee-Wragg - Head of Art
<p>
A reminder to all those students who completed Art GCSE.  Please collect your coursework as 
soon as possible during breaktimes or at the end of the day.  Please do not come into the 
department during lessons.

<font size=+1>WATERSPORTS TRIP HYÈRES, FRANCE</font>
<br>Miss J Simpson - Head of Girls P.E.
<p>
35 Year 10 pupils and 5 members of staff left Charters in the blazing sunlight on
Sunday 25th July heading for Hyères, France.  20 hours later, early Monday morning, 
we arrived at PGL, Hyères to be greeted by our enthusiastic, energetic and far too awake 
PGL reps.  The pupils were kept busy all week, spending days on the beach learning sailing, 
kayaking, windsurfing and snorkelling skills.  The weather was excellent, with only one
rainy day, although the wind conditions weren’t ideal for some watersports.  Evening 
entertainments included a musical quiz, talent show, a trip to St Tropez and dancing 
at the disco.  A particular favourite was go-karting, with pupils, staff and PGL reps 
skidding, crashing and spinning at corners, all racing round the track to record the 
fastest lap time.  The pupils had an enjoyable week, returning to Charters, tanned 
and exhausted!!

<font size=+1>Home/School Partnership </font> Mrs M Twelftree - Headteacher
<p>
As a large school with 1500 pupils, the school works with over 3,000 parents. 
Parents are a vitally important part of school partnership, but during this 
year we have been conscious of very few parents being involved with the Charters 
School Association.  The Association has done a magnificent job this year in raising 
enormous sums of money to provide a new minibus and other resources urgently needed 
by the school.  I have been rather disappointed that, despite huge parental praise for 
the school, very few parents are prepared to come along and support the Association. 
Its efforts are limited to a very small willing band of helpers.  Even if you can
offer only a little time to the school, please contribute in some way to the Charters 
School Association.  I would ask all parents to carefully read  the information that 
follows and consider how they can best help the school.  Thank you for your 
co-operation in this matter.


<p>
<font size=+1>Welcome to the Charters School Association</font>
<p>
Charters School Association (CSA) would like to extend a warm welcome to all 
the new families that have joined Charters School this year.  All staff, parents 
and guardians of students at Charters are automatically members of the CSA.  The 
CSA aims to support the staff and students at the school through raising funds 
and organising social events.
<p>
FUN AND FUND RAISING
<br>
Most of the fund raising is done at the Christmas Market, Spring Draw and Summer Fayre.  
Through working together the staff, CSA committee, parents and students ensure these 
events are a real success, raising money to benefit all pupils throughout the year.  
Not all of the events are exclusively fund raising as a Skittles evening and Quiz Night 
is organised every year.  In 1998/99 enough money was raised to buy a new minibus, the 
Charters Chariot and support further developments to the computer network in school.  
Every year the CSA provides prizes to celebrate the achievements of the students.

<p>
HOW CAN YOU HELP?
<br>
Organising the various events throughout the year is hard work, but rewarding and fun. 
Every family can make a contribution, offering a level of involvement that fits in 
with their other commitments.  Please consider what you could do, your help is needed 
and will make a difference.  The enclosed forms enable you to register your support 
and should be returned to the school office on completion or brought to the AGM on 
Tuesday, 5th October.  Thank you.

<p>
CSA COMMITTEE
<br>
The committee of the CSA meets two evenings per term and new committee members 
are always welcome.  In fact, for the CSA to function properly we need new parents 
to join each year, both to replace the committee members whose children have left 
the school and to bring in new ideas.  If you are interested in joining the committee 
but would like further information, please contact Jill Rakowski (01344 422379).

<p>
JOIN THE HELPERS LIST
<br>
The CSA maintains a Helpers List to enable the committee to co-ordinate the support 
needed each year at Charters School.  The list is used to keep a record of who might 
be available to help at a range of fund raising and social events, as well as serving 
refreshments on parents’ evenings and open days.  The CSA needs as many parents to
volunteer as possible.  Please think twice before saying you cannot help.  If you 
are unsure about adding your name to the list please contact Jill Rakowski (01344 422379)
or Denise Tomlinson (01344 884378).

<font size=+1>House System Update </font>Mr I Wright - Overall House Co-ordinator
<p>
The new contest for the 1999-2000 Charters School House Competition has now started. 
Runaway winners last year Churchill (Green), must look to emulate what was a truly
memorable performance. However, Nightingale (Yellow), Pankhurst (Red), Armstrong 
(Blue) may have something to say in how the championship is decided! Many competitions
have already begun or are due to do so soon. House Rugby and Hockey fixtures begin 
next week with the Year 9 competitions on Monday 27th September, Year 10 Wednesday 
28th September and  Year 11 Thursday 30th September. The Year 7 & 8 competitions
are later in the half term on Saturday 18th October and, of course, the more spectators,
whether friends, fellow House members or parents the better! Other competitions now 
running are the Year 7 History competition where pupils have to research information
about the historical character their House is named after and then describe why they
deserve such a position. Further details in this issue of Charters News.   Finally, 
a new competition. Many students may be aware that each House has an appropriately 
coloured House Mascot. Now is your chance to rack your brains and think of a nickname 
for your House’s Mascot. Entries must be in to Mr. Wright by Friday 8th October and 
hopefully will be judged by a Senior Member of Staff. Look for further details on 
the House noticeboard or in your Tutor room.
<p>
Current champions, Pankhurst, are in for some stiff opposition from the three challengers 
and the first test takes place in the form of Year 9, 10 and 11 House rugby and hockey on
the 22nd, 23rd and 24th September respectively. The competitions will all run from 3-4 p.m. 
and all are welcome. There are many new competitions planned for this year, including a
Public Speaking Contest and a House Quiz but first up is a 'House Motto' competition
where pupils are invited to come up with a motto which can be used for their House. 
There are House Points at stake for the best entries and also the most, so get thinking!
All entries to your House Co-ordinators or Mr. Wright.
<p>
Well all I've got left to say is good luck to everyone involved this year in what 
promises to be a great contest, and remember your House needs you !
