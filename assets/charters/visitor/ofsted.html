<P>“Results in the tests taken at age 14 at the end of Key Stage 3 (KS3) are well above
 the national level and it is clear that the school enhances its pupils’ attainment 
by this stage. This enhancement is further confirmed at the end of KS4 in its GCSE results,
 which are well above the national averages. Results have been improving over recent years, 
and reached their highest this year.
 The school maintains this high achievement in its A level results, which are well above 
average both for grades A and B and in all pass grades.”
