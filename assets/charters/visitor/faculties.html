FACULTY OF ENGLISH
<div align=right><a href="#top">Top of page</a></div>

<P>English is a varied subject and most pupils are talented in at least one aspect of it.
Our choice of books, methods and subject matter recognises talents and encourages 
pupils to teach their full potential.

<P>Pupils are taught to speak and write in a variety of different modes and the study of 
literature plays an important part in the course.  The continuous assessment of written
coursework is important throughout the five years of the course.  Students are also taught
how to write effectively under timed conditions in preparation for public examinations. 
Oral skills are emphasised and students are taught to listen and respond in a variety of 
different situations.

<P>All pupils study a GCSE course appropriate to their own interests and abilities.  Careful
setting here, as elsewhere, enables us to match the demands of the course and the chosen
texts very precisely to the needs of pupils.

<P>'A' level English is a very popular course.  Students study a syllabus, which has a coursework
element and an open book examination.  Charters was the first school in Berkshire to follow this syllabus and has achieved excellent results.

<P>There are also many extra-curricular activities including theatre visits, poetry workshops and
public speaking competitions.

FACULTY OF MATHEMATICS
<div align=right><a href="#top">Top of page</a></div>


<P>The Mathematics Faculty aims to help all pupils experience success in Mathematics.  We also 
want pupils to develop an awareness of the fascination and power of Mathematics as well as a
confidence in their own ability so that they achieve high standards.

<P>Mathematics lessons include problem solving, investigational and practical work both with and
without calculators (which may be scientific or graphical) as well as more traditional work.

<P>Our aim is to make our pupils aware of the challenging, but rewarding, and enjoyable nature 
of the unique subject that Mathematics is.

<P>In Year 7, pupils work for half a term in mixed-ability groups before being put into sets.
From then until the beginning of Year 10, in each half-year group of five sets, there will
be twice-yearly movements between sets to reflect any changes in the relative performance of
pupils.

<P>All pupils take their National Curriculum test at the end of Year 9 and their GCSE at the end
of Year 11.

<P>Mathematics is a popular subject at 'A' level, where we study Pure Mathematics, Statistics 
and Mechanics modules, and we also offer a one year course for those in the Sixth Form who wish to improve their GCSE grades.

FACULTY OF SCIENCE
<div align=right><a href="#top">Top of page</a></div>

<P>The Faculty of Science aims to make Science Education interesting and relevant and to enable
all pupils to reach their potential.  We help our students to share the excitement and 
enjoyment which scientific discovery and increasing scientific knowledge can bring.

<P>In the Lower School, we have a modular course.  Students begin with three induction modules
which develop their experimental and scientific reasoning skills.  These include the use of 
datalogging and computer modelling.  Fifteen units of work are then studied, culminating in 
the National Tests at the end of Year 9.  In each Year, students receive a balance of Physics,
Chemistry and Biology.

<P>In Years 10 and 11, the Science Faculty offers two courses, NEAB Co-ordinated Science and 
NEAB Modular Science.  Although the organisational and assessment arrangements differ, both
courses are broad and balanced in content, lead to a dual GCSE award and occupy 20% of the
students school time.

<P>Success in these courses could lead to further scientific study at GCE Advanced level in 
Biology, Chemistry and Physics.

<P>The Faculty organises and supports many extra curricular events ranging from Electronics
Club and Environment Club in Year 7 to Work Experience for Sixth Form students.  In addition,
students will have the opportunity to meet and work with scientists from industry and other
areas during the course of their studies.

FACULTY OF MODERN LANGUAGES
<div align=right><a href="#top">Top of page</a></div>

<a href="../faculties/modernlanguages/index.htm" target=_parent>Visit the Modern Languages pages</a>
<br>
<P>The Faculty aims to provide introductory language courses, which are both enjoyable and
relevant, to enable pupils to communicate on a basic personal level with native speakers
and to generate an enthusiasm for the study of foreign languages in general.

<P>Pupils are taught to understand, speak, read and then write in the foreign language using
a variety of teaching strategies to take account of differences in pupil ability.

<P>French is the first foreign language taught to all Year 7 pupils and this is being done via
a number of topics - an approach continued through successive years.  In Year 8, all pupils 
begin additionally to learn Spanish.

<P>It is a statutory requirement that all pupils study at least one modern language to GCSE level
and, where appropriate; they are encouraged to continue with the study of both.  Both languages
are also taught to 'A' level.

<P>Charters is fortunate in having French and Spanish native speakers in the Faculty, in addition 
to two foreign language assistants from the same countries.

<P>Because of the communicative nature of these subjects, it is essential that pupils be given
opportunities to reinforce their language learning abroad and, accordingly, there are day
study visits, exchanges and work experience placements.

FACULTY OF EXPRESSIVE ARTS
<div align=right><a href="#top">Top of page</a></div>


<P>The work undertaken in this Faculty is in line with the latest developments in GCSE and
 National Curriculum.

<BR>
<BR>
ART

<P>Art activities are designed to promote the development of skills enabling pupils to express
themselves creatively.  A comprehensive range of technical competencies is taught within the
context of critical and historical studies.  Drawing from observation, imagination and 
experience are the basis of all work.

<BR>
<BR>
DRAMA

<P>Creating drama - by exploring texts, researching, improvising and structuring ideas - 
challenges pupils to respond actively, developing modes of self-expression and confidence
through performance.  Imagination, problem-solving and decision-making are fostered.  
Group work encourages social interaction skills, improving awareness and consideration for 
others.  Examination courses widen study to the technological aspects of Theatre Arts.

<BR>
<BR>
MUSIC

<P>We aim to promote a better understanding and appreciation of Music through active 
involvement in listening, performing and composing.  This is a practical course in 
which the pupils experience a variety of musical cultures and traditions and have the
opportunity to take part in extra-curricular activities and concerts.  Peripatetic 
support is provided for those pupils who wish to learn an instrument.

<P>In Art, Drama and Music, study visits are made to relevant places of interest to support
examination coursework.

<P>Special Educational Needs, PSE, Careers, Work Experience, Community Service, and National 
Records of Achievement.

<P>At Charters we provide for the individual needs of pupils.  Those pupils with Special
Educational Needs are identified and assisted throughout their School career by Specialist 
Teachers overseen by the Head of Special Educational Needs.  A system of support, including 
assistance from outside agencies, helps pupils who have learning problems.

<P>Statemented pupils with disabilities are usually integrated in all aspects of the curriculum
and all statemented pupils will receive some NTA support in the classroom and help from the
Sixth Form Community Service programme.  Full-time welfare assistants are employed to cater
for the general welfare of the physically disabled and are based in the Resource Centre.

<P>All pupils follow a tutorial programme.  Additionally, Personal and Social Education is part
of the Core Curriculum in the Upper School.  In Year 7, the tutor period is taught by form
tutors and in Years 10 to 13 an experienced team is responsible for an extended programme 
which includes Careers, Work Experience and National Records of Achievement which prepares 
pupils for adult life.  Outside agencies such as 'The Careers Service' support the School's
programme.

<P>Modules of work involving personal relationships and drugs education follow Statutory Guidelines
and are taught in appropriate contexts.

THE FACULTY OF HUMANITIES
<div align=right><a href="#top">Top of page</a></div>

<a href="../faculties/humanities/sociology.html" target=_parent>Visit the Sociology homepage</a>

<P>This curriculum area includes some of the subjects that help to understand people: Geography,
History, Religious Education, Sociology and Psychology.  It aims to provide all pupils with
knowledge and understanding that will enable them to take an active and informed part in
society.

<P>Geography will enable pupils to understand major problems and issues in the world and to 
acquire useful skills for work and leisure.  History promotes understanding of the past, 
leading to an understanding of the modern world.  Geography builds fieldwork skills using
the local area, Tirabad and further afield e.g. the South of France.  History visits places
such as the Somme battlefields and Kentwell: a Tudor house in Suffolk.

<P>Geography and History are taught as separate subjects in Years 7 to 11 and are options in
Years 10 and 11.  They are popular and successful 'A' levels.

<P>Religious Education is provided in accordance with the Agreed Syllabus for Religious
Education adopted by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead.  Parents may request that 
their child be withdrawn on those occasions when Religious Education is taking place.

<P>Religious Education helps to explain many aspects of History, to define beliefs and values, 
and to contribute to moral development.  Above all, it helps a pupil gain understanding 
different beliefs, experiences and practices.

<P>Religious Education is timetable in Years 7 to 9.  It is an option in Years 10 and 11 and 
part of the PSE programme.  It is also an expanding 'A' level.

<P>Sociology and Psychology are increasingly popular 'A' levels.

<P>The Business Faculty brings together those subjects from the school curriculum that relate 
directly to the world of work.

<P>The I.T. department is responsible for ensuring all pupils will learn and develop I.T. skills 
throughout their time at school.  The groundwork is laid in Year 7 with dedicated lessons, 
but skills are developed in each curriculum area until Year 11.  Some students opt to take a 
specialist I.T. GCSE course in Years 10 and 11.  The I.T. equipment available is up-to-date 
and replicates that which is found in industry.

<P>Business Studies is a very popular option at GCSE and provides a good general introduction 
to the 'world of work'.  Pupils can then opt to take a range of Business Courses in the Sixth 
Form.  All of these provide an excellent basis for entry onto degree courses or employment.

<P>Economics is studied only at 'A' level and has an excellent track record in terms of 
examination results.  It is an extremely popular option for Sixth Form students and many 
students choose to study Economics at degree level.

<P>This curriculum area includes some of the subjects that help to understand people: Geography,
History, Religious Education, Sociology and Psychology.  It aims to provide all pupils with
knowledge and understanding that will enable them to take an active and informed part in

FACULTY OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION
<div align=right><a href="#top">Top of page</a></div>


<P>The Physical Education Faculty aims to encourage all pupils to take part in a wide range of 
physical activities and to encourage a positive attitude towards health, fitness and physical
recreation.

<P>In Key Stage 3, pupils will participate in a range of sports and also have the opportunity to 
participate in outdoor pursuits at Tirabad Residential Centre.

<P>During Years 10 and 11, pupils are able to experience new activities not previously offered
including weight training, squash and step aerobics.  Students will also have the opportunity 
to choose 3 sports, which will be covered in more depth.  Alongside these opportunities, pupils
can also opt to study GCSE Physical Education (Short Course) and the Junior Sports Leader
Award (JSLA) Course.

<P>All Sixth Form pupils take part in Physical Education and a wide range of activities is 
available on and off the school site.

<P>As a department we can also offer Physical Education to 'A' level in the Sixth 'Form. 
As an extension to the JSLA Course, pupils can gain the Community Sports Leader Award in 
the Sixth Form.

<P>The Physical Education Department aims to encourage a lively interest in all physical
activities, which will allow each pupil to develop his/her potential in a number of 
different area.  This can hopefully be achieved not only within PE lessons but during 
extra-curricular activities where a diversity of after school clubs are available, as 
well as the opportunity to represent the school in the many school places offered.

<P>Work within the PE curriculum is designed to complement, contribute to and support the
aims of the school.  It offers a comprehensive range of experiences to meet the needs
of individual pupils who are encouraged to participate, irrespective of their abilities 
and to become actively involved.

FACULTY OF DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY
<div align=right><a href="#top">Top of page</a></div>


<P>Design Technology, through the areas of Resistant Materials, Food Technology, Graphic 
Products and Textiles, aim to prepare pupils for effective living in a fast changing 
technological society and in so doing equipping them with the flexibility needed to cope
with life and independence.

<P>Through a wide-based curriculum pupils learn to overcome unforeseen problems and adapt
their ideas in the light of constraints imposed by the materials, tools and processes 
available to them.  Consideration is also given to the impact of technology on the way we live.

<P>A wide selection of materials are used and pupils learn about the properties of these and 
methods of combining these to enhance their characteristics.  In all areas of this subject,
pupils are encouraged to produce practical work of high quality.

<P>Food Technology focuses on using food creatively, nutrition, health and hygiene, consumerism 
and appliance testing.

<P>In Textiles, pupils investigate different textile materials leading to an understanding of 
the creative use of colour, texture and pattern in textile items.

<P>Resistant Materials concentrates on wood, metal and plastics.  Other areas covered include
the use of mechanisms, structures, electronics and the use of I.T. Control Technology to 
achieve desired outcomes.

<P>This approach is used throughout all years, including GCSE and 'A' levels.
