<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Religious Education Department at Charters School is a lively and innovative department.  It is staffed by two full time specialists and two non-specialists. The department is housed in two purpose built rooms in the Humanities block. We offer an extensive range of courses from Key Stage 3 through to Key Stage 5. The modules which are taught at Key Stage 3 are based on the Berkshire Agreed Syllabus. The Key Stage 4 course comprises a study of Religion and Life from a Christian Perspective and a study of Buddhism. At Key Stage 5 students follow a course on Christianity in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries and a study of Philosophy and Ethics in the modern world. Religious Education also makes a major contribution to the delivery of the PSHE programme </P>
