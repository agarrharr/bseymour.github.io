<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Hinduism is believed to originate from
near the Indus Valley on the Asian subcontinent. Not all Hindus call their
religion Hinduism. Many prefer the term Sanatan Dharma. Sanatan means eternal.
Dharma means law or religion or duty. The Indus Valley was home to a great
civilisation 4000 years ago and the cities of Mohenjo and Harappa (which
are in modern Pakistan) have provided archaeologists with clues as to the
people and their lives. It seems that the rulers were priests. Fragments
of pottery suggest that they worshipped a mother goddess who ensured the
fertility of the land.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Another view which exists is that which
claims from about 1800bce a wandering group called the Aryans settled in
the area bringing with them their religion, customs and traditions. According
to this view Hinduism grew out of the meeting of the two cultures. Therefore
from its earliest beginnings Hinduism included a wide variety of beliefs
and practices.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Hinduism arrived in the United Kingdom
after the Second World War, Britain was short of workers and people from
the British Commonwealth countries were encouraged to move and take up
work there. Many Hindus made their home in the UK bringing with them their
religion and way of life.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
