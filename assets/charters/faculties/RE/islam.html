<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Muslims trace the origins of their religion
back to the first human being who they believe was Adam. According to teachings
of Islam Adam was the first man and the first Muslim.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The word Islam means peace. Islam also
means submission or giving in. A Muslim is someone who submits to the will
of Allah. Allah is the Muslim word for God. Muslims believe that everyone
is born with free will. Therefore everyone has a choice to follow their
own path driven by greed, desire and selfishness or to follow a path which
leads to peace. Adam was the first person to submit in obedience and faith
to the will of Allah.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">There have been many prophets and messengers
of Allah who all delivered the same message that is to worship Allah. Allah
is the one true god and there is no other god. The last and final prophet
was Muhammed. He was born in Mecca in what is now Saudi Arabia. It was
here, in the mountains outside Mecca that Muhammed received the words of
the Qu'ran. Muslims believe the Qu'ran contains the word of Allah and that
his final revelation marks the completion of Allah's message.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
