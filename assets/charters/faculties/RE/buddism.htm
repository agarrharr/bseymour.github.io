<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The current teaching of Buddhism began
in northern India with the life and teachings of Gotama Buddha (Buddha
means enlightened one). He was born in about 563 bce. When he grew up he
went in search of the truth about life. Having found it he spent the rest
of his life teaching others how they might find enlightenment. His teachings
became popular and he had many followers. They came to be known as Buddhists.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">After he passed away the Buddha's followers
took his message to other parts of India. It gradually spread eastwards
to places like Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Nepal, China and Japan. As
it spread Buddhism met and was influenced by other religions. Gradually
three main types of Buddhism developed. Theravanda Buddhism became the
main form in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand. This tradition claims to
carry on the earliest practices and beliefs and to have scriptures (the
Pali Canon) which contain the actual words of Siddartha Gotama. Mahayana
Buddhism is strongest in China and Japan and the tradition in Tibet and
Mongolia is known as Vajrayana Buddhism. The different forms emphasise
different paths to enlightenment.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">For centuries very little was known about
Buddhism in the west. Travellers and scholars particularly those from the
USA, the United Kingdom and Germany began to learn about it in the early
years of the nineteenth century. However Buddhism was not practised in
Britain until the beginning of the twentieth century. In 1926 the Buddhist
Society was formed. Most Buddhists in Britain are people who have personally
chosen to adopt this way of life.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>
