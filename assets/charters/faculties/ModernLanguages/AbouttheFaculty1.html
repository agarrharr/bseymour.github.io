</U><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#00ff00"><P>The Faculty of Modern Languages comprises ten permanent members of staff in all: eight who teach exclusively within the Faculty, (four of whom teach part-time) and two who also teach in other departments. The Faculty is also fortunate to have two foreign language assistants, who are contracted on a yearly basis from October to May. All pupils are required to study French in Years 7-9, and most study Spanish in Years 8 and 9 and at least one of these languages in Years 10 and 11. The majority of pupils follow a full course to GCSE, although a small number follow&nbsp; a&nbsp; Certificate of Achievement course. Both languages are offered to A-Level in the Sixth Form and the Faculty has an impressive track record of results to date.</B></FONT> </P>
