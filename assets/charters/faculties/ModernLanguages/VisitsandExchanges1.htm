fifty pupils in each year half are given the opportunity to participate
in a one-day study visit to the Pas-de-Calais region in northern France
on the first two Fridays in June. A coach is chartered from the school
and back, using the Channel Tunnel <I>Le Shuttle</I> service which maximises
the time pupils have in France. Pupils are required to complete a number
of different transactional language tasks in groups using a specially designed
workbook and are given the opportunity to speak French in a number of the
different situations.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

The Visit is intended primarily as a holiday, but would prove to be most beneficial to pupils studying Spanish.
The proposed itinerary will include a visit to the Cabarceno Natural Reserve, the medieval
town of Santillana del Mar, a visit to a cake factory, shopping assignments, and one or two treats
not usually available to the average British tourist!  The three-star family run hotel is across the road 
from a blue flag beach.  There will be time for supervised beach activities during the visit.
<BR>
The dates of the visit are from Sunday 28th May 2000 to Saturday 3rd June 2000.</P></FONT></FONT></FONT>

locations (Sunningdale and Cagnes-sur-Mer) are well placed as regards the
airports used (London Heathrow and Nice C&ocirc;te d'Azur). Excursions
are made to Cannes, Nice, Antibes, Monaco, Monte Carlo and Grasse and documentation
is prepared in advance on these visits and a diary (written largely in
French) is kept by each pupil.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
