<P>The department.</P>

<P>Currently there are 2 Psychology trained teachers, Mr C Riley
(H.O.D), and Mrs A Dodd.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We have 2 A Level sets in years 12 and 13. They are following
a 2 year programme. They are assessed by 2 x 3 hour exams at te
end of the 2 years, plus 2 pieces of coursework. These are 2 pieces
of psychological research done written up as a scientific journal
paper. The examining board is AQA.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>However the structure of the course will alter from September
2000 in accordance with the changes required by governent. Although
the structure will change, and possibily the assessment procedure,
the content topics will be, by and large, the same as now.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These are:</P>

<P>Social Psychology e.g. Crowd behaviour, pro and anti social
behaviour, obedience to malevolent authorities.</P>

<P>Biological psychology eg how do animals communicate? Is it
like us? How do dogs learn to lead a blind person?</P>

<P>Abnormal psychology e.g. mental illness, therapies and treatments.</P>

<P>Developmental psychology early years attachment bonds, the
development of thinking and intelligence, changes in old age.</P>

<P>Cognitive pyschology e.g. memory and forgetting, paying attention,
language development.</P>

<P>Methodology and satistics e.g. how do psychologists conduct
their scientific research so how do we know what we know so far?
(a grade C at GCSE Maths is most important)</P>

<P>We study the main school of thought that form the world of
thinking in psychology. It is these that make psychological discussion
so diverse and controversial. e.g. Freudian thinking. Behaviourism,
Humanistic approaches to the person.</P>

<P>Finally there is a course in Ethics to do with ow we treat
people animals and the vulnerable in society. (the young, old
and sick)</P>

<P>The department has a good supply of books, videos and copies
of Journal papers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>You will read a lot, write a lot, apply logical and scientific
thinking to your work.</P>

<P>And become very SMUG&gt;
