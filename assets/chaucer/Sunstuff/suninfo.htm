<P>The Sun is the most prominent feature in our solar system. It is the
largest object and contains approximately 98% of the total
<BR>solar system mass. One hundred and nine Earths would be required to
fit across the Sun's disk, and its interior could hold over
<BR>1.3 million Earths. The Sun's outer visible layer is called the photosphere
and has a temperature of 6,000&deg;C (11,000&deg;F). This
<BR>layer has a mottled appearance due to the turbulent eruptions of energy
at the surface.

<P>Solar energy is created deep within the core of the Sun. It is here
that the temperature (15,000,000&deg; C; 27,000,000&deg; F) and
<BR>pressure (340 billion times Earth's air pressure at sea level) is so
intense that nuclear reactions take place. This reaction causes
<BR>four protons or hydrogen nuclei to fuse together to form one alpha
particle or helium nucleus. The alpha particle is about .7
<BR>percent less massive than the four protons. The difference in mass
is expelled as energy and is carried to the surface of the Sun,
<BR>through a process known as convection, where it is released as light
and heat. Energy generated in the Sun's core takes a
<BR>million years to reach its surface. Every second 700 million tons of
hydrogen are converted into helium ashes. In the process 5
<BR>million tons of pure energy is released; therefore, as time goes on
the Sun is becoming lighter.

<P>The chromosphere is above the photosphere. Solar energy passes through
this region on its way out from the center of the Sun.
<BR>Faculae and flares arise in the chromosphere. Faculae are bright luminous
hydrogen clouds which form above regions where
<BR>sunspots are about to form. Flares are bright filaments of hot gas
emerging from sunspot regions. Sunspots are dark
<BR>depressions on the photosphere with a typical temperature of 4,000&deg;C
(7,000&deg;F).

<P>The corona is the outer part of the Sun's atmosphere. It is in this
region that prominences appears. Prominences are immense
<BR>clouds of glowing gas that erupt from the upper chromosphere. The outer
region of the corona stretches far into space and
<BR>consists of particles traveling slowly away from the Sun. The corona
can only be seen during total solar eclipses.

<P>The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years and has enough
fuel to go on for another five billion years or so. At
<BR>the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium into heavier
elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing so large that it
<BR>will swallow the Earth. After a billion years as a red giant, it will
suddenly collapse into a white dwarf -- the final end product of
<BR>a star like ours. It may take a trillion years to cool off completely.
