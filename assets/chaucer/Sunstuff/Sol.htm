Sun is an ordinary G2 star, one of more than 100 billion stars in our galaxy.
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; diameter:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,390,000 km.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mass:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.989e30 kg
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; temperature: 5800 K (surface)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15,600,000 K (core)</PRE>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sun is by far the largest object in the solar system.
It contains more than 99.8% of the total mass of the Solar System (Jupiter
contains most of the rest).

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sun is personified in many mythologies: the Greeks
called it Helios and the Romans called it Sol.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sun is, at present, about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium
by mass (92.1% hydrogen and 7.8% helium by number of atoms); everything
else ("metals") amounts to only 0.1%. This changes slowly over time as
the Sun converts hydrogen to helium in its core.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The outer layers of the Sun exhibit differential rotation:
at the equator the surface rotates once every 25.4 days; near the poles
it's as much as 36 days. This odd behavior is due to the fact that the
Sun is not a solid body like the Earth. Similar effects are seen in the
gas planets. The differential rotation extends considerably down into the
interior of the Sun but core of the Sun rotates as a solid body.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Conditions at the Sun's core are extreme. The temperature
is 15.6 million Kelvin and the pressure is 250 billion atmospheres. The
core's gases are compressed to a density 150 times that of water.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sun's energy output (3.86e33 ergs/second or 386 billion
billion megawatts) is produced by nuclear fusion reactions. Each second
about 700,000,000 tons of hydrogen are converted to about 695,000,000 tons
of helium and 5,000,000 tons (=3.86e33 ergs) of energy in the form of gamma
rays. As it travels out toward the surface, the energy is continuously
absorbed and re-emitted at lower and lower temperatures so that by the
time it reaches the surface, it is primarily visible light. For the last
20% of the way to the surface the energy is carried more by convection
than by radiation.

<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he surface of the Sun, called the <B>photosphere</B>,
is at a temperature of about 5800 K.&nbsp;<A NAME="sunspots"></A><B>Sunspots</B>
are "cool" regions, only 3800 K (they look dark only by comparison with
the surrounding regions). Sunspots can be very large, as much as 50,000
km in diameter. Sunspots are caused by complicated and not very well understood
interactions with the Sun's magnetic field.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT> small region known as the <B>chromosphere</B>
lies above the photosphere.

<P><IMG SRC="eclipse77b.gif" HSPACE=4 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=150 WIDTH=150 ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he highly rarified region above the chromosphere,
called the <B>corona</B>, extends millions of kilometers into space but
is visible only during eclipses (left). Temperatures in the corona are
over 1,000,000 K.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sun's magnetic field is very strong (by terrestrial
standards) and very complicated. Its magnetosphere (also known as the heliosphere
extends well beyond Pluto.

<P><IMG SRC="xraySunICON.gif" HSPACE=4 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=90 WIDTH=90 ALIGN=RIGHT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT SIZE=+2>I<A NAME="solarwind"></A></FONT>n addition to heat and light,
the Sun also emits a low density stream of charged particles (mostly electrons
and protons) known as the solar wind which propagates throughout the solar
system at about 450 km/sec. The solar wind and the much higher energy particles
ejected by solar flares can have dramatic effects on the Earth ranging
from power line surges to radio interference to the beautiful aurora borealis.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Recent data from the spacecraft Ulysses show that the solar
wind emanating from the polar regions flows at nearly double the rate,
750 kilometers per second, that it does at lower latitudes. The composition
of the solar wind also appears to differ in the polar regions. And the
Sun's magnetic field seems to be surprisingly uniform.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further study of the solar wind will be done by the recently
launched Wind, ACE and SOHO spacecraft from the dynamically stable vantage
point directly between the Earth and the Sun about 1.6 million km from
Earth.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The solar wind has large effects on the tails of comets
and even has measurable effects on the trajectories of spacecraft.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT SIZE=+2>T<A NAME="solarconstant"></A></FONT>he Sun's
output is not entirely constant. Nor is the amount of sunspot activity.
There was a period of very low sunspot activity in the latter half of the
17th century called <I>the Maunder Minimum</I>. It coincides with an abnormally
cold period in northern Europe sometimes known as the Little Ice Age. Since
the formation of the solar system the Sun's output has increased by about
40%.

<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Sun is about 4.5 billion years old. Since its
birth it has used up about half of the hydrogen in its core. It will continue
to radiate "peacefully" for another 5 billion years or so (although its
luminosity will approximately double in that time). But eventually it will
run out of hydrogen fuel. It will then be forced into radical changes which,
though commonplace by stellar standards, will result in the total destruction
of the Earth (and probably the creation of a planetary nebula).
