the things from the week go onto that pupils record of achivement
which means that you can go to a 'Job Interview' and prove that you
can do more than just your GCSE says. For Instance say you was the
captain of the Cricket Team it shows you can organisn a team or say
you`ve played in a orcestra it shows you can learn a instrument and
preform in front of a audience. </CENTER></P><IMG SRC="eyes.gif">
