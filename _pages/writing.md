Main topics I’ll be rapidly covering: 1) Multi screen journey and adaptive content&#8230;

###### [Over-Engineering : 800 years of operation](http://allbs.co.uk/2014/04/04/over-engineering-800-years-of-operation/). This amazing structure was NOT the crowning glory of Marshall’s dreams, it was a secondary feature, a beacon to encourage and safeguard the traffic that he needed for the business venture he was looking to establish.

###### [The Apprentice Bowl](http://allbs.co.uk/2014/03/31/the-apprentice-bowl/). The most impressive part of the tour was seeing ‘The Apprentice Bowl’. An incredibly intricate bowl, incorporating every pattern that Waterford employs with it’s crystal glass, and requiring 600 precision cuts, each one made by hand, anything less than perfection and the item is smashed and recycled back into the next batch&#8230;

###### [Image SEO and Dynamic Media Systems](http://allbs.co.uk/2013/01/07/image-seo-dynamic-imaging/). The image and video verticals in search engine results pages (SERPs) do not yet tend to be as hotly contested over as the textual content elements of SEO. Yet, video and images both make up part of the prime real estate that is the first page of search results.

###### [Lynx on Mac : The Text-only Browser](http://allbs.co.uk/2013/03/02/installing-lynx-on-mac/). Following Paul’s (@paulrobertlloyd) session at Responsive Conf I was really curious to try out Lynx, which is a text-only browser. I was intrigued with looking at the world from such a limiting perspective, and the notion of viewing the web with no design-overlay really resonated.

###### [Healthy Working ](http://allbs.co.uk/2014/01/05/healthy-working/). Get-fit-while-working. In lieu of a sit/standing desk, I’m going to give this a bash as part of my new 2014 regime.

###### [Terminal Velocity](http://allbs.co.uk/2013/09/05/its-terminal/). I had one of those problems to solve, that initially had me toying with blowing the dust of some Python, but it struck me as the perfect time to spend more time on my Mac’s Command Line&#8230;

It’s a relatively small change, but makes for a more real-world use case.
