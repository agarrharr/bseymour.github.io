My Myers Briggs

A couple of times a year someone brings up Myers-Briggs in conversation, and I rarely remember what mine is meant to be, so here seems as good a place as any to put it for future reference:

Myers Briggs: ENFJ

Extraverted (89%) iNtuitive (75%) Feeling (12%) Judging (56%)

very expressed extravert
distinctively expressed intuitive personality
slightly expressed feeling personality
moderately expressed judging personality
eNFj : The Portrait of the educative mentor or  Teacher Idealist

The Idealists called Teachers are abstract in their thought and speech, cooperative in their style of achieving goals, and directive and expressive in their interpersonal relations.
