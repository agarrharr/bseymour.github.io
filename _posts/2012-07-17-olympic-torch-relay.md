As we left the house to walk in to town to see the Olympic Torch relay pass through our town (<a title="Wallingford" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallingford,_Oxfordshire" target="_blank">Wallingford</a>, Oxfordshire) I mostly grumbled about why on earth we had to be there an hour early. But then I wasn&#8217;t prepared for the amazing volume of interest, excitement&#8230; and well, people who were also heading in to watch the torch pass through our little town. One of our main green spaces had been turned into a temporary car park, and was completely rammed full of cars from neighbouring villages. It was a great atmosphere and it was so great to have a front row position to see the Olympic carnival, headed by <a title="Raymond Blanc" href="http://www.manoir.com/web/olem/le_manoir.jsp" target="_blank">Raymond Blanc</a> as our torch bearer, pass through our little town.

(p.s. I am also taking this opportunity to finally start experimenting with the <a title="NextGen Gallery" href="http://www.nextgen-gallery.com/" target="_blank">NextGen Gallery</a> plugin for WordPress (and so far it is a refreshingÂ improvement))
