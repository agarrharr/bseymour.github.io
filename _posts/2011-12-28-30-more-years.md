I read an article today describing how half of today&#8217;s 50 year olds would need to work until they are 77 in order to make ends meet.

Viewing work on such a timescale puts an interesting tilt on ones perspectives about work&#8230;..

So the question is:Â  if you could only work for 1 more year &#8211; what would you do with that time?

How about 5 more years? or 10, or 20 years?

For adulthood, as we continue to age what are the changing shapes of the constraints that are pushed upon us by nature, physiology?

Or our experience, risk perception, society, culture, evolving technological and environmental changes, our own evolving families?

And what to are the other side to that coin &#8211; our evolving opportunities, knowledge, experience, potential?
