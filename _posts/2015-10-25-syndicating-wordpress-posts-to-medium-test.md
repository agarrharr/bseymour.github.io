As you may [have read](https://medium.com/the-story/taking-medium-to-the-next-level-cb7f223fad86#.tdrtg79q2) Medium recently released their publishing API, making it easier to post content to Medium.

IFTTT has subsequently added a connector for Medium, so it is possible to setup a ‘recipe’ which cross-posts any WordPress posts over to Medium.

This post &#8211; is to test that process.
