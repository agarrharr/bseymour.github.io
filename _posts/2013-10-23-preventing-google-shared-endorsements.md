Google have been really up front about their intentions around Google Shared Endorsements, which kick in on 11th November.Â If you&#8217;d rather not have your Google+ profile and +1&#8217;s used for as part of Google adverts, you need to update your Google+ profile settings to turn off &#8220;Shared Endorsements in Ads&#8221;.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 0px;" title="Screen Shot 2013-10-23 at 21.25.53.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013 10 23 at 21 25 53" src="/images/allbsuploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-23-at-21.25.53.png" width="358" height="126" border="0" />

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Steps to follow</span>

1) When logged in to Google+, at the top right corner, select &#8216;Account&#8217;

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screen Shot 2013-10-23 at 21.22.52.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013 10 23 at 21 22 52" src="/images/allbsuploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-23-at-21.22.522.png" width="335" height="255" border="0" />

2) Select &#8216;Google+&#8217; and scroll down to &#8216;Shared Endorsements&#8217; and click &#8216;Edit&#8217;:

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 0px;" title="Screen Shot 2013-10-23 at 21.24.01.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013 10 23 at 21 24 01" src="/images/allbsuploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-23-at-21.24.01.png" width="420" height="177" border="0" />

3) On the next page Google provides loads of information about the benefits of being part of the Shared Endorsements, but if you&#8217;d still rather not, uncheck and &#8216;Save&#8217;.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 0px;" title="Screen Shot 2013-10-23 at 21.24.29.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013 10 23 at 21 24 29" src="/images/allbsuploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-23-at-21.24.29.png" width="420" height="64" border="0" />

.. and that&#8217;s it. Again kudos to Google for being upfront about it all, and for making it relatively easy to opt out of.
