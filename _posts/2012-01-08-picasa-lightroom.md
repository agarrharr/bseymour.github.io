For 5 years Picasa has been just what we needed for family day-to-day photo management, but lack of sync between multiple machines means it&#8217;s no longer tenable as my wife and I need to use our separate machines more and more.

We&#8217;re going to start looking at transitioning over to Lightroom, and probably moving away from PicasaWeb as the host too. (Ideally I would like to use an Amazon Web Services hosted OpenPhoto based solution) 

I just hope we can find a workflow that is as simple and hassle free as the Picasa/PicasaWeb combination has been.

We&#8217;ll be using Scott Kelby &#8216;s &#8216;Lightroom 3 for for digital photographers book&#8217; &#8211; only a little way in, but so far it is a engaging and enjoyable read.
