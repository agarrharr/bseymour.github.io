The Echostar HDS-600RS is a brilliant unit: FreeSat HD, dual inputs, live pause/replay, slingbox and relatively reasonably prices. However, there is an issue I&#8217;ve had twice now, where the remote control just stops working. It took me quite some searching to find the solution the first time, so I&#8217;m making a note of it here in case I need it again some day.

It seems that the remote control becomes un-paired from the base unit. In some cases it appears that this is the result of some other universal remote control interfering with the base unit, though I&#8217;ve encountered it without having any other such remote controls in the house.

On the HDS-600RS remote:

1) press and hold the left and right arrow keys for five seconds (until LED stays on)

2) Using the numeric keypad, enter digits 1 2 6 (LED blinks three times)

3) While pointing the HDS600 remote at the STB, press and hold the right arrow and OK keys for five seconds (until LED blinks 2 times).

** I found these instructions were at the following URL, but struggled to find it again when I needed it a second time: <a href="http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?t=1703767" target="_blank">http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?t=1703767</a>
