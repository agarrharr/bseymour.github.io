The new Adobe Summit app was just launched, and it&#8217;s really good &#8211; and after a quick download, it already has the majority of info offline if needed.

Hopefully you are coming along to the Summit as there are a stack of great speaker and sessions lined up &#8211; our Scene7 mobile session is the last session of the second day.. so I rather hope there will be plenty of coffee nearby.

p.s. to take screen shots on an HTC Desire/HD/Sensation = power + home
