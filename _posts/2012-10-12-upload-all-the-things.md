After 9 years as our ISP we move away from @EclipseInternet. After a crazy amount of problems and delays with the sales/ordering process, which took 2 months(!) it was a relief that the BT Engineer was brilliant  &#8211; called in advance, really nice bloke, and everything up and running before 9am ! Well done @BTbroadband, and thanks Lenny

Currently 75Mbps downstream + 13Mbps upstream = very happy me <img src="http://allbs.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

BT Home Hub so far better than expected: Gigabit ethernet, FON (off by default) and super easy to update the SSID to our previous one.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">To Do</span>:

1)after nearly a decade with a static external IP address &#8211; need to find a way to map/track the now dynamic IP address

2) Find a reasonably powerful yet energy efficient home server. Something to run a local JIRA, and Open Wonderland and be on 24/7 without costing a fortune&#8230;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reasons for switching</span>:

Several people have asked why switch after so long &#8211; the main reason for moving away was the inability of Eclipse to adapt their new Fibre broadband plans. I&#8217;ve really loved being on a rolling monthly agreement with them for nearly a decade &#8211; I love the freedom of feeling I can move away from them if ever I needed to&#8230;.

Sadly Eclipse Internet Fibre packages were for minimum 12 month contract only &#8211; when pushed, their (lovely) customer services indicated it was because they couldn&#8217;t risk investing in the line setup and then having me leave. I emphasised that if they were going to tie me in to a contract, I would have to do due diligence, and see what their competition was like&#8230;

Having done my research and found just how great the BT Fibre deals were, I called them back to highlight, that if they could not find a way to trust their long term loyal customer, that instead of it being just a risk that I might leave them.. that they were actually guaranteeing  it.

&#8211; and so here we are&#8230;. I just hope BT can deliver the kind of great service that Eclipse have done for the last decade&#8230;
