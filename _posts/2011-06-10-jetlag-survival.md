I&#8217;m not a big fan of flying, but holidays, client site visits and forming a better working relationships with remote colleagues means that it is likely to keep needing to happen &#8211; at least until a Start Trek transporter type device is finally made generally available.

On long haul, they seem typically like to bring around food 30 mins into the flight&#8230;. shortly after this switch your watch to destination time&#8230; and more importantly  switch your thinking and eating to destination time too.

It&#8217;s  often tempting to think about how its &#8216;really&#8217; 3am etc&#8230; but try not too.

Try to force yourself to the new eating patterns as soon as you can, you probably won&#8217;t be hungry, but try it anyway. For me this was something I only recently started doing on the back of advise from a US based colleague.

Flying west ie to US from UK, generally feels easier. Resist  having a nap on arrival, and do your best to hold out until a reasonable local evening time.

Flying east ie US to UK, I find this a much harder transition. It&#8217;s pretty key to sleep as much as possible on the flight&#8230; I sometimes deliberately have a bad nights sleep the night before, to increase the odds.

Take earplugs and eye shades&#8230; they don&#8217;t seem to have these available by default these days (at the back of the plane anyway). Good noise cancelling headphone turn the flight into a much more serene place to be (I have folding Sennheisers). I find the &#8216;meditation&#8217; audio channel in the in-flight entertainment is surprisingly effective as getting me to nod off, or at least to making the time seem to pass unnoticed.

Buy water at airport  despite the price&#8230; so you can hydrate  throughout  the flight without being reliant on the stewards.

I load my Tablet (Asus Transformer) with a stack of PDF magazines, and Kindle novels and novellas, but also take a magazine (normally Wired) as you can&#8217;t use electronic devices for the first and last 15 odd minutes of the flight.
