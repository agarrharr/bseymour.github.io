At the start of November, and with very little prior thought, I commenced two month-long activities:  "[Movemeber](https://uk.movember.com/mospace/13503125)" and "[NaBloPoMo](http://nablopomoguideunofficial.blogspot.co.uk/)".
Here we are, at day 15 - halfway through!


I'd fallen out of the writing habit quite badly during 2016, and NaBloPoMo was the right gentle nudge at just the right time (I'd not even heard of NaBloPoMo until November 1st). If I'm honest, I'm feeling a little blogged-out, and a little uncertain about making it to the end of the month, but I've found it really positive to have made it this far. There is a page detailing the posts to date: [https://benseymour.com/nablopomo/](https://benseymour.com/nablopomo/).


The facial hair side of things is progressing well, though is pretty itchy - and I've also probably taken more selfies this month than in the last 5 years combined. This is to [raise funds](https://uk.movember.com/mospace/13503125) for The Movember Foundation to support trying to prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and mental health.

Tomorrow could be interesting, as my customer on-site is in Stuttgart, so it'll be interesting to see what the face recognition machines at Heathrow passport control can tell that it's me!
