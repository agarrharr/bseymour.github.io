Everyday I come across rather large quantities of very interesting materials, insightful articles, tools, libraries, that inevitably need to go on my to-read, or to-remember lists. I use Chrome&#8217;s sync&#8217;ed bookmark with folder like &#8216;GoodUns&#8217;. &#8216;Reference&#8217;, and social bookmarking via <a title="Delicious " href="http://www.delicious.com/ben.seymour" target="_blank">Delicious  </a> (which I stopped really using after all the ownership changes in 2012). Between:

&#8211; the extremely interesting people I follow on Twitter (as <a title="Twitter bseymour" href="http://twitter.com/bseymour" target="_blank">@bseymour</a>)

&#8211; the mostly interesting people I follow on Google+ (<a title="Google+ Ben Seymour" href="http://benseymour.com/+" target="_blank">benseymour.com/+</a>)

&#8211; the couple of hundred RSS feeds I monitor via my <a title="Google Reader Subscriptions" href="http://www.google.com/reader/public/subscriptions/user/17701434611552206926" target="_blank">Google Reader subscriptions</a>

&#8211; various news and tech sites I regularly browse

This glut of valuable resources just keeps growing at an ever expanding rate, and so I have more recently settled upon 3 distinct apps/services:

&#8211; <a title="Get Pocket" href="http://getpocket.com/" target="_blank">Get Pocket</a> (formerly Read-it-later) &#8211; this is my &#8216;to-read-sometime-soon&#8217; list &#8211; I use the Android app on my phone/tablets to keep me entertained while on the train, or when the kids have got me up in the night and I can;t get back to sleep. This also where I dump endless  resources that either become or support pet-projects.

&#8211; <a title="PinBoard" href="http://pinboard.in" target="_blank">PinBoard</a> &#8211; $10 for &#8216;no ads, no fluff&#8217;  &#8211; I typically use this for my &#8216;to-remember&#8217;. It&#8217;s easy to mark for private or public, and has good meta data support, so this is my long term collated-web archive.

&#8211; <a title="InstaPaper" href="http://www.instapaper.com/" target="_blank">Instapaper</a> &#8211; (optional upgrade $1 per month) save web pages for later, which I primarily use to send offline copies of articles to my Kindle to read it while on my commute, especially while underground. (I use a weekly scheduled task to avoid completely cluttering my Kindle)
