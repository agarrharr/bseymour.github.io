Thanks to the web's empowerment of self-publishing, and social media making it incredibly easy to re-share what they feel is valuable or interesting articles, I find myself awash in an ever-expanding sea of content. Like many people, I encounter this in different contexts, be it via twitter on my mobile while traveling, or via facebook at home on my tablet, or my RSS reader on my desktop machine.

These articles typically fall into 3 categories:
- uninteresting, or poor quality
- sufficiently interesting for a single read, or perhaps share
- extremely interesting and valuable, something I can envisage wanting to be able to read again, and therefore find at some point in the future

Twitter, Facebook, Google + (rarely these days)
Feedly - link to OPML

Pocket -
is my backlog .. my 'reading debt'
is meant to be my 'to-read' list, however it's in need of a big old clean-out
Evernote - web clipper
Stache - for inspirational ...
Storify ...
Delicious
Pinboard - private / public - widget...


Re-share - twitter, Facebook (personal), Facebook (CodeParents), LinkedIn
Buffer


Additionally my own content, is typically either editorial content, to be shared on this blog, or maybe photos - and I described my photo workflow earlier this month.
