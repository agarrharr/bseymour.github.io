Possessing an always-connected, social integrated smartphone triggers any number of life changing potential and behaviours, including the rather significant fact that most people carry cameras in our pockets at all times.

and social networks have changed many people's behavioural patterns such that it is now the norm to take photos of the activities around you, or to take selfies, or of your dinner, or a coffee.


Curation - is an act of love

Memories - research suggesting that our memories...
... for example how many of your memories are real, or how many were enhanced, or even created by you repeatedly seeing photos in say the houses of your family members and friends.

The power of photos, in bringing people together, in sharing moments, in strengthening memories and ties.
There is also a power in photography, in encouraging you to be mindful and aware of the beauty surrounding you... and I suppose the counter to that, is in being distracted by the act of taking the photos

-- photo of old lady and the pope smartphones etc.....

weekly - cureation
Reflecting on the weekend

monthly - as the number of phtoos we take increases it's easy for the value of some of those individual photographs to get lost in the woods...

DropBox
directories

Having previously used Mac's Photos app, Google's Picasa and Adobe's Lightroom, each with their own catalogue and ways of organising them and being able to share them, I've learned the hard way, that the simplest and safest way to maintain an order or structure to my photo collections is to use the file systems directory structure (potentially further enhanced with image meta-data).


Flickr - friends and family - over 48,000 photos... public, closer to 3000
Exposure - but lack of mobile workflow...?
500px ...
