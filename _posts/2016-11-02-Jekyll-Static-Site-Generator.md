As mentioned [yesterday](../01/Getting-back-into-blogging), having decided to move away from a database-based blog-aware site I started looking into static site generators. (Though inspired by Aral's [Breaking Things](http://www.breakingthin.gs/) I did also consider building my own locally scripted solution).  

[StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/) is a fantastic resource for reviewing the top Open-Source Static Site Generators, and it is so heartening to see that there are so many highly active and lovingly maintained projects.

Friends had recommended Middleman, and I'd seen a lot of positive writing about Jekyll, so they formed my (very) shortlist. After a maddeningly unproductive first attempt with Middleman a few months ago, I gave Jekyll a try, and found it much smoother running.  

More details are available on the [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/)
Or directly from their [github repo](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)

Github also uses Jekyll under the covers for it's project pages, and effectively provides free hosting via '[GitHub-pages](https://pages.github.com/)' (a.k.a. gh-pages), with a simple-to-get-started-with automatic regeneration workflow when you commit new content to the repo for your gh-pages site - but more on that tomorrow.
