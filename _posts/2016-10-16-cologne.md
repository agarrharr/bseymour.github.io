# Cologne

i am currently travelling in Cologne, and wanted to explore the feasability of posting an uodaye, while on the road, using only my phone. (not even the folding bluetooth keyboard I wished i had packed)

I've been absorbed by the view from my hotel window, and have found it mesmerising using 'Slow Shutter' app to see the river of light painted by the cars and trams below.
