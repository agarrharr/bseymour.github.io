For the few months since I switched my main PC to Windows 7, I have generally been pretty happy with the experience, however there has been an annoyance which has niggled me (though clearly not enough to investigate until now).

Grouping of objects in the task bar is a much nicer space saver , and as someone who is prone to having a large number of windows open at a time, I no longer have to have my task bar at triple height.

Reopening a specific window in a group via right-click is all well and good:[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265" title="win7 right click group" src="http://ox10.it/allbs/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/win7-right-click-group.png" alt="windows 7 task bar group - right click" width="272" height="285" />](http://ox10.it/allbs/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/win7-right-click-group.png)

but I only just discovered that if you hold SHIFT while right clicking, you get the cascade/stack options, which make some workflows much nicer:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266" title="win7 shift right click" src="http://ox10.it/allbs/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/win7-shift-right-click.png" alt="Windows 7 task bar group - SHIFT right click" width="253" height="164" />](http://ox10.it/allbs/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/win7-shift-right-click.png)

and holding CTRL while left clicking causes each group item to cycle in turn.
