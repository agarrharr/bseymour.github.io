<span style="color: #37404e; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">In lieu of a sit/standing desk, Iâ€™m going to give this a bash as part of my new 2014 regime. There are stacks of reports about the dangers of sitting all day, and while I hope to buy an electric sit/standing desk sometime this year, I will try out doing gentle steady cycling while working. In my first try I missed having my big monitor close, but it would be fine for email activities, and I cycled 5km without barely noticing (though I have a new saddle gel cover on order)</span>

[update: Feb 9th] January&#8217;s tally was 92 miles gentle riding while doing emails during the day, or social networks, surfing in the evening. I also tried it while playing the PS3 but my legs insisted on trying to keep pace with the in-game characters!

[update: Feb 20th] I&#8217;ve already hit 100 miles in February &#8211; probably in part thanks to season 2 of House of Cards ðŸ˜‰

[update: August &#8217;14] It&#8217;s a bit less comfortable using the bike while working now that summer has hit, but I&#8217;ve now totally 450 miles cycled since the start of the year]
