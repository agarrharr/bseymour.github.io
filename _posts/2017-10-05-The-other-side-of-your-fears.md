> "Everything you ever wanted is on the other side of your fears."

I've just scheduled my first micro-light flight. While I have to regularly fly on commercial airlines for work, I also give talks on 'making the most of your fears' centred around how I feel about flying....

Here's hoping the weather is calmer than my current state of mind!

Below are the audio recording and the slides from my [MKGN](https://mkgeeknight.co.uk/) talk on 'Making the most of your fears'.

(p.s. I used VLC to convert the .mp3 to Vorbis/.ogg, and added a new include to handle the code for utilising html native audio)
