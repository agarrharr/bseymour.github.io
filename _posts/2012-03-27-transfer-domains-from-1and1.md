After the frustrations as detailed in my earlier post (&#8216;<a title="All BS : 1&1, savings not worth the cost" href="/2012/03/27/1and1-savings-not-worth-the-cost/" target="_blank">Savings not worth the cost</a>&#8216;) there were unsurprisingly more frustrations ahead I as started transferring my domains away from them (to Namecheap, who are so far providing a great level of service).

In case anyone else has encountered similar problems, I will detail the workflow here:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For .com domains</span> (from 1&1 to Namecheap):

In the 1&1 admin panel, select the .com domain, then click the &#8216;Info&#8217; button &#8211; here you should see an &#8216;unlock&#8217; button, click this, and make a note of the Auth Code (a.k.a. EPP code).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-470" title="1and1 transfer com domain" src="/images/allbsuploads/2012/03/1and1-transfer-com-domain.png" alt="" width="494" height="386" srcset="/images/allbsuploads/2012/03/1and1-transfer-com-domain-300x234.png 300w, /images/allbsuploads/2012/03/1and1-transfer-com-domain.png 494w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" />

When ordering the domain transfer from the Namecheap site, you will need to enter this EPP code (Auth code) in order to proceed.

A follow-on email is sent to your Reg-C email address which you must approve to continue.

**Total completion time around 5 days** (for the 3 or 4 domains so far transferred)

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For .co.uk domains</span> (from 1&1 to Namecheap):

The key here is that as well as taking the normal route of ordering the transfer via the Namecheap site, you also have to enter the &#8216;Contracts&#8217; section of the 1&1 site, and **initiate a cancellation of the domain**!

This involves logging in to the alternate 1&1 site: <a title="https://contract.oneandone.co.uk/login" href="https://contract.oneandone.co.uk/login" target="_blank">https://contract.oneandone.co.uk/login</a>

Selecting the &#8216;Cancellation&#8217; buttons from the top (this always makes me nervous)

Under cancellation options select: &#8216;**Individual domains/additional items**&#8216;

Tick the domain to be transferred, and change teh drop down &#8216;return to NIC&#8217; to &#8216;change of provider&#8217; , then &#8216;Next&#8217;

and finally on the next screen enter the &#8216;provider tag&#8217; (a.k.a. IPS tag): in the case of Namecheap this is ENOM (though I would suggest you double check this yourself before proceeding).

Finally &#8216;confirm&#8217; and bob&#8217;s your uncle. You get a mostly pointless confirmation email from 1&1 indicating that you have cancelled something&#8230; but without any actual useful details.

And that&#8217;s it &#8211; amazingly, the 3 .uk transfers I have done to date have **completed in 2-4 hours!**
