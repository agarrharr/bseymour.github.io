Just came much closer to being feasible. I&#8217;m not at all a fan of typing on soft keyboards, and have tried a couple of folding Bluetooth keyboards but rarely travel with them. However Swype finally came out of beta and is available on the <a title="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nuance.swype.dtc&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5udWFuY2Uuc3d5cGUuZHRjIl0." href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nuance.swype.dtc&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5udWFuY2Uuc3d5cGUuZHRjIl0." target="_blank">Google play store</a> (currently just 69p).

[update: the posting via Dragon voice to text is surprisingly good too&#8230; even over 3G]

[further update May 12 2013: after several weeks of use, I can confirm that for me Swype is a game changer &#8211; I will now consider my mobile phone as a content creation/entry device in considerably more circumstances than I have over the years I;ve had a touch screen device]
