Performance, Reward and motivation. Studies show that:

  * As long as a task uses only mechanical skill, structured financial rewards work as expected i.e. higher rewards lead to greater performance
  * However, once a task calls for even rudimentary cognitive skills, larger incentives lead to poorer performance

Money is only a partial motivator at work. If you don&#8217;t pay enough people are not motivated. But the best use of money is to pay just enough to stop the lack thereof from being a blocker.

**3 factors lead to better performance:**<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Autonomy &#8211; Mastery &#8211; Purpose</strong></span>

Autonomy: Old style management is great if you want compliance, but if you want engagement self-direction is better.

Mastery: people just like getting better at things, and most people happily spend their spare time pursuing such activities through their hobbies.

Purpose: when the profit motive gets disconnected from the purpose motive poor behaviours emerge, and quality of service drops.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Organisations and people who flourish &#8211; have great purpose.</strong></span>
