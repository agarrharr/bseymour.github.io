With <a title="https://www.twilio.com" href="https://www.twilio.com" target="_blank">Twilio </a> now offering full UK telephony support*, I spent part of my day off today exploring their platform &#8211; and I&#8217;ve got to say, I&#8217;m thoroughly impressed.

With $30 credit on signing up, and $50 extra credit thanks to meeting the UK Twilio team at the <a title="http://events.jquery.org/2012/uk/" href="http://events.jquery.org/2012/uk/" target="_blank">jQuery UK</a>  conference in Oxford last week &#8211; that left me with $80 of credit on a platform that is very reasonably priced.

So far I&#8217;ve got the following working:
  
&#8211; programmatical SMS message distribution
  
&#8211; programmatical SMS auto response
  
&#8211; simple IVR (interactive voice response)
  
&#8211; voicemail transcription -> email (transcription accuracy was not that great)
  
&#8211; and my personal favourites, outgoing browser based calls to landlines/mobiles

After a lot of experimenting, and some extended calls from my account out to mobile phone for voice tests, I only managed to spend $4.50 (including the $1 to rent a UK number  for the month).
  
So much potential and so many applications, I&#8217;m looking forward to getting a little more time for further exploration soon.

* I was looking into some Telephony services for a pet project last year, and while Twilio were not supporting the UK at that time, I instead explored SkypeKit and Tropo, finding much more potential available via Tropo at that time.
