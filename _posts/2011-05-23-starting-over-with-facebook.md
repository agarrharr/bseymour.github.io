After a really interesting and insightful presentation by Christian Hernandez (Facebook’s Head of International Business Development) at the Adobe Omniture Summit last week, I&#8217;ve decided I&#8217;m really overdue spending more time exploring Facebook from both an end-user&#8217;s perspective, and as a business/commercial platform.

Step 1: research hooking Facebook status updates into my already habitual twitter posts.

Thankfully, after about 20 seconds of Googling, this turned out to be trivial due to the &#8216;Selective Twitter&#8217; app on Facebook: http://apps.facebook.com/selectivetwitter

Just add #fb to the end of the Tweet, and it gets copied to Facebook too.

I suspect that the two platforms really need a different approach to their communications styles, but for now I&#8217;ll try this dual-threaded approach.

[Update] N.B. A friend (who has recently started their small business) forwarded me this, post relevant to &#8216;<a title="How to use Facebook to grow small business" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2191088_use-facebook-grow-small-business.html" target="_blank">How to Use Facebook to Grow a Small Business</a>&#8216;. It could be interesting trialling this with my wife&#8217;s company.
