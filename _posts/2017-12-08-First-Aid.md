TL;DR Follow this links to [book a first aid course](https://www.sja.org.uk/sja/training-courses/courses-for-the-general-public/essential-first-aid-all-ages.aspx). These are definately lessons to learn before you need them.  

 

After a stranger collapsed in my arms recently and stopped breathing, I finally attended a St. John Ambulance Essential First Aid course.

Our trainer Liz was phenominal. 4 hours of intense, detailed, brilliantly explained guidance on dealing with all manner of situations. We had many questions and every single one was answered comprehensively.

I learned that over 90% of people in Germany hold a first aid certificate (it is mandatory and tied to their drivers license), whereas that number in the UK is less than 40%.

I learned that being apply to give CPR to someone unresponsive and not breathing inceases their chance of survival by around 20%, and that the appropriate use of a defibrilator (an AED) can increase this to nearly 75%.


For an investment of just £30 and an afternoon, I would encourage everyone to consider learning some essential skills that hopefully you’ll never need.
