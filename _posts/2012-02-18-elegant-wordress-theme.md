I&#8217;ve been meaning to experiment with different WordPress Themes for this blog for some time, and recently came across another blog that I really liked the feel of. Exploring a little further took me to <a title="Elegant WordPress Themes" href="http://www.elegantthemes.com/affiliates/idevaffiliate.php?id=14035" target="_blank">Elegant WordPress</a> which had a nice looking selection of Themes (at a particularly reasonable price of $39 p/a) and with a developer subscription option ($89 p/a) which means that you can also access the PSDs, which will come in as a cracking starting place when I start to work on my own Theme later in the year.

They also have a great affiliate programme, so if you also happen to like the look of their work, please feel free to use my affiliate link: <a title="Elegant WordPress Themes" href="http://www.elegantthemes.com/affiliates/idevaffiliate.php?id=14035" target="_blank">http://www.elegantthemes.com/affiliates/idevaffiliate.php?id=14035</a>
