Iâ€™m really thrilled that my Responsive Images flow is currently being featured on Gibbon.co

<https://gibbon.co/bseymour/responsive-images>

With some great progress now being made to the formalisation of the Responsive Images support in modern browsers, I&#8217;m pulling together a core of useful web resources around Responsive Images solutions.

[Gibbon](https://gibbon.co/) is a really promising new community of people learning from each other by collecting and sharing the knowledge from the web. I really like their &#8216;playlists for learning approach&#8217;
