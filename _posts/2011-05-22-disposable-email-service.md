There are some sites which need you to register in order to see some content, or access downloads, and while many will accept aaa@aaa.aa, many like to be force you to respond to an email to ‘prove’ that the email address is in use.

For a while I have had an email address along the lines of random999@hotmail.etc, which I used for registering on sites where I didn’t want to give an email address out.

Now there is an easier way of providing a temporary, working email address, without the risk of constant spam:

<a title="10 Minute Mail" href="http://10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html" target="_blank">10 Minute Mail</a>

It exists just long enough to get the email confirmation side of things sorted.
