None of the usual tricks worked for taking a screen shot on the Nexus7, but it turns out to be:

Press both the &#8216;down volume&#8217; button and power button simultaneously for about a second.

In case useful:
  
&#8211; on my HTC Android phones it us usually: hold power button + soft &#8216;home&#8217; button
  
&#8211; Asus Transformer (TF101) long hold the &#8216;running apps&#8217; soft key.

Fragmentation, what fragmentation!
