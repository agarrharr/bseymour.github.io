We&#8217;re on holiday up on the stunning Holy Island, and it&#8217;s a perfect opportunity to make some improvements to my [current Timelapse workflow](http://allbs.co.uk/2013/05/12/timelapse-via-android-mobile/).  I&#8217;m now using my old Desire XE as a dedicated time-lapse shooting device, and the Joby Grip Tight and GorillaPod are still proving extremely useful:

The Android App &#8216;LapseIt Pro&#8217; continues to be excellent for phone-only time-lapse rendering, but my day-long shoots generate around 9000+ images, and the Desire XE just can&#8217;t cope with the processing needed, and transferring to the Nexus4 is crazily slow (and inefficient).

Enter the &#8216;Time-Lapse&#8217; app for Mac:

&#8211; easy drag and drop my batch of images straight from finder.

&#8211; simple and quick setting of format, frames per second, and speed multiple

&#8211; applying rudimentary crop across the sequence

&#8211; it&#8217;s a bargain at £2.99!

I&#8217;ve just used it with a sequence of 5300 photos (totalling around 1.5GB)of the sunrise over Holy Island from our [cottage](http://www.coblecottageholyisland.co.uk/). It took seconds to set to 24fps and 10x speed, plus a little crop as per the above screen shot, and then literally a few minutes to render out the as a moderately high quality .mp4 which you can see here (hosted on Vimeo):

In this follow on test with the time-lapse of the whole day, apply a crop, apply some compression, and set at 10x speed.  (I used a stopwatch app) It took 50 seconds to import the **15,000 photos** (5.6GB), and a further 4m 50s to create the rendered video output: [whoops &#8211; I&#8217;m too close to exceeding my Vimeo storage to be able to upload this week, so I&#8217;ll have to use YouTube]:
