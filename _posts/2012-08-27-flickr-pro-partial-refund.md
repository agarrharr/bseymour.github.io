Within 15 minutes of signing up for Flickr Pro I was getting a sinking feeling about the usability of their platform:

  1. I just couldn&#8217;t figure out how to download my original file, with it&#8217;s original filename.
  2. I also couldn&#8217;t find anyway to download the &#8216;original sized&#8217; version of my photos without doing it on an image by image basis &#8211; no apparent sign of a bulk or batch process for this.

Within 24 hours of signing up for Flickr Pro (the time taken for Flickr Support to respond to my questions) I finally had confirmation that this platform wasn&#8217;t unintuitive, it actually doesn&#8217;t support #1/#2 and so turned out to be a poor fit for my needs.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>No refunds</strong></span> &#8211; it was in the small print, so I can only blame myself for not approaching my relationship with Yahoo! with much more caution&#8230;. but from an ongoing relationship perspective I think Yahoo! should consider the benefits of easing the situation when someone has been disenchanted with their services by considering some kind of pro-rata reimbursement &#8211; especially when concerns had been raised so rapidly after payment &#8211; otherwise people may perceive giving them money as a much bigger risk than it needs to be.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Possible workaround for a partial refund</span>**

The only bronze lining to this cloud is that I may have found a way to at least claw back a little of the annual subscription fee:

  * there is the option to &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;">Change your subscription</span></strong></span>&#8220;

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8220;When you choose a new Pro subscription you will receive a refund for any unused time on your current subscription. You will be billed for a new subscription. Your new subscription will begin immediately.&#8221;

  Pasted on 2012-08-26 from <<a href="http://www.flickr.com/account/order/manage/">http://www.flickr.com/account/order/manage/</a>>
</p>

  * You can then select &#8220;3-month Pro at $6.95&#8221;

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  I received an email confirmation:
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8220;This is a confirmation that you have changed your Flickr Pro subscription period. We&#8217;re issuing <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><strong>a prorated refund for any unused time on your current subscription</strong></span> and billing you for the new subscription period. Your new subscription begins immediately.&#8221;
</p>

  * I am now awaiting to see my updated Credit Card statement to see if they are good to their word.

[update] As of 30 Aug, my credit card is only showing $6.95 &#8211; I&#8217;ll keep an eye on it, but at this point it appears that I&#8217;ve been successful in cutting back the amount of money that was not refunded.

PicasaWeb has clearly spoiled me &#8211; after over 5 years of using it as our main photo sharing platform we had come to expect these levels of functionality as standard &#8211; apparently, Flickr/Yahoo consider such functionality to be either superfluous or luxurious

My next steps are to try out my last best hope: <a title="http://theopenphotoproject.org/" href="http://theopenphotoproject.org/" target="_blank">OpenPhoto </a>

&#8212; more to follow.
