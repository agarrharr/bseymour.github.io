I was fortunate enough to see Richard Stallman&#8217;s (rms) talk at Oxford Uni today titled &#8216;**For A Free Digital Society&#8217;**.

In trying to describe who rms is to a friend I came up with the following:

The future may look back on Stallman, and consider him to be more important than Jobs and Gates&#8230; but that future would need to be one in which the value of material wealth has decreased considerably.

I tend towards a more balanced perspective on some of the things he talked about today, but I love his dedication to an ideal that he so clearly believes in &#8216;soup to nuts&#8217;.

Note to self:

It&#8217;s not Linux, it is GNU plus Linux,

It&#8217;s free not open (rms uses &#8216;gratis&#8217; to mean $0 pricetag, free to mean you can view, edit, distribute the source)

Whatever you don&#8217;t put that picture you took of him on Facebook!
