Android WordPress is offline as I type this, testing how it responds.

[Update]: It responded very well :)

The Asus Transformer Android Tablet with a (nearly) full-size keyboard-dock coupled with this offline WordPress Android App make for a very compelling and very travel friendly combination (I just hope the keyboard-docks become available in the UK soon)
