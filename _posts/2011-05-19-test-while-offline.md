Android WordPress is offline as I type this, testing how it responds.

[Update]: It responded very well <img src="http://allbs.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

The Asus Transformer Android Tablet with a (nearly) full-size keyboard-dock coupled with this offline WordPress Android App make for a very compelling and very travel friendly combination (I just hope the keyboard-docks become available in the UK soon)
