On November 1st, in a rather impromptu fashion, I decided to commit to both NaBloPoMo and Movember and NaBloPoMo. (Jump to: [NaBloPoMo summary](#nablopomo))

# Movember
I mentioned the 2 challenges were somewhat impulsive, and in the case of Movember apparently I forgot to mention it to my wife before posting about it to friends on Facebook!

I've been blown away by the support received, with Â£260 donated. (It's still open for donations: [http://mobro.co/bseymour](http://mobro.co/bseymour))

School pickup has been interesting. We've been picking the kids up from the same school for 5 years now: A surprising number of parents hadn't noticed any difference! Several parents didn't recognise me, and clearly viewing me suspiciously on two occasions I was asked "If I needed help" (a.k.a what the heck are you doing on the school grounds).
The kids (both ours, and others at the school) however found it hilarious.

I also took more selfies this month, than probably in my whole life to date - so that I could make into a time-lapse/morph:

As far as my son is concerned though, the coolest part was when Commander Chris Hadfield (former Commander of the international Space Station, and one of Jack's big heroes (and mine)) liked my photo on Twitter!

I'd been struggling to get back into blogging regularly. In part because of the issues with my Wordpress install, in part because I've been struggling to figure out the audience I'm writing for.

NaBloPoMo is National Blog Post Month, which has the challenge of writing a blog posts each day for the whole of November. I'd not heard of it before 1st November, and it sounded like just the tonic for getting back into writing. I'm happy to say it has been everything I had hoped it would be, and probably more.

All the posts can be seen here: [NaBloPoMo 2016](/nablopomo/)

My personal favourites, include some topics I'd been meaning to write about for a long time
