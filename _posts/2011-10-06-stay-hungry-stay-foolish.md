Like many, I find myself watching this more than once today. Steve Jobs&#8217;Â 2005 Stanford Commencement Address:

&#8220;Remembering that you are going to die is the best way to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose&#8230; there is no reason not to follow your heart.&#8221; .&#8221;Know what you truly want to become&#8221;.
