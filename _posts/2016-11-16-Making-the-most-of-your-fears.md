I'm not a fan of flying. I have a pretty good cognitive grasp of the physics, engineering tolerances, flight crew ongoing training and testing procedures. But a small irrational part of me has a tendency, unbidden, to come to the conclusion that this is 'the end'.

One suggestion is that a fear of flying relates to a lack of control, but really: 

>The only thing you can really control is your perspective.

There is a 'family' album on my phone which I enjoy just prior to taxiing, and active noise cancelling headphones are great investment

I also tend to distract myself during the flight, by doing things like writing this post

# Life Audit
However, mortal fear, even when unwarranted, it a great opportunity for a life audit.
What are you doing today, that it might be beneficial to reduce or stop as they add less to your life than they take away?
Which are the things you would wish you had done... if this was the end?

Over the years this has led to some tweaks to my lifestyle
TODO --- link to healthy working posts/video... and also the changing habits one. 

I also returned to the classroom, and as a volunteer, teach primary children to code. (Always over subscribed, despite being after school on a Friday).
>It's amazing what you learn, when you try to teach something.

And also to tentatively start a site/community helping less/non-technical parents and guardians to support their children in exploring coding: [Code.Parents()](https://codeparents.org).
 
Embarking on writing my first book, turned out to be a significant challenge, that I grew to realise I had shied away from due to a lack of confidence.

One of the most impactful changes, was to significantly change the pattern of my working week. With fantastic support from my [employer](http://amplience.com) earlier this year I changed to part time working.

Which has given me the time, energy and focus to be more 'present' with my family, and to better support my wife in pursuing some of the challenges that she is passionate about (SYP, Seymour Potential)
